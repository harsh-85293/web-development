.translated {
    transform: perspective(15px) translateZ(-10px);
}

perspective(15px): This defines a perspective of 15px, meaning objects appear to have
depth, and the further an element is along the Z-axis, the more dramatically it will 
scale (as if you’re looking at it in 3D space). A smaller perspective value creates
a stronger depth effect.

translateZ(-10px): This moves the div 10px into the screen (negative Z-axis), making it
appear smaller as it moves away from the viewer.

.scaled {
    transform: perspective(350px) scaleZ(6) rotateX(45deg) rotateY(30deg) rotateZ(15deg);
}

perspective(350px): This sets a much larger perspective of 350px, meaning the 3D effect
is less exaggerated than the .translated class. Objects appear more natural and further
away.
scaleZ(6): This scales the element along the Z-axis by a factor of 6, making it appear as
if it is larger or stretched out along the Z-axis (depth).

rotateX(45deg): Rotates the element 45 degrees around the X-axis (horizontal axis). This
gives a tilted appearance as if you’re looking at the element from above or below.

rotateY(30deg): Rotates the element 30 degrees around the Y-axis (vertical axis), which
tilts the element left or right.

rotateZ(15deg): Rotates the element 15 degrees around the Z-axis (the axis that comes out
of the screen), causing a slight clockwise rotation.
