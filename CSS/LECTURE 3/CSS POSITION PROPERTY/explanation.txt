If uncommented, it would set the position of all <p> tags to static, which is the default.
 Static positioning means the element will flow naturally in the document layout, without
any special positioning behavior.

position: absolute;: The element with the ID box3 is absolutely positioned. This means it
is removed from the normal document flow and placed relative to its nearest positioned
ancestor (if there is one) or relative to the browser window.

top: 100px; left: 50px;: The top-left corner of box3 will be positioned 100px from the top
and 50px from the left of its containing element (or the viewport if no positioned parent
is present).

If uncommented, it would position the #box1 element fixed relative to the viewport,
meaning it would stay in the same position even if the user scrolls.

position: sticky;: The element #box4 will behave like a relatively positioned element
until the page is scrolled, at which point it will "stick" to the top of the container
(or viewport) as soon as it reaches the top: 0px position.

top: 0px;: This makes the element sticky when the user scrolls, and it will stick to the
top of the screen (or its container) when scrolling down.

(100vw means 100% of the browser window's width).
