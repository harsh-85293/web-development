Purpose: Specifies the character encoding for the HTML document.
Explanation: UTF-8 is a character encoding that can represent all characters in the 
Unicode character set, including many characters from different languages, special symbols,
and emojis. This ensures that text on the webpage is displayed correctly across different
browsers and platforms.

Purpose: Defines how the webpage should be displayed on different devices (especially
mobile devices).Explanation: This meta tag controls the page's layout on mobile browsers.
It ensures responsive design by setting: width=device-width: The width of the viewport
(visible area of the web page) should match the width of the deviceâ€™s screen.
initial-scale=1.0: Sets the initial zoom level when the page is loaded to 100%. 
This prevents the page from being zoomed in or out by default on mobile devices, 
making it display as intended.

Purpose: Specifies the title of the web page.
Explanation: The text inside the <title> tag is what appears in the browser's title bar 
or tab when the page is open. It also plays an important role in SEO (Search Engine 
Optimization) and is used by search engines to display the title of the page in search 
results.

properly.The second meta tag ensures the web page is responsive and scales properly
on different screen sizes, particularly for mobile devices.
